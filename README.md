## 1. Citizen friendly report of diversitydatakids.org
###   Abstract: 
-   (idea#8) Using Divrsitykids datasets, create a dashboard and use NLG to generate a citizen friendly report.
-   About Diversitydatakids.org: It is a research project that examines who our children are, whether they have what they need to grow up healthy and achieve their full potential, whether social policies are well designed to improve childrenâ€™s lives and how to make them better to improve equity. 
-   Data collected by diversitydatakids is in tabular format, which makes it difficult for a general citizen to understand the content. 
-   Our goal is to convert few topics of this tabular content to a citizen friendly report so that it becomes more readable & helps increase awareness among citizens.
###   Approach:
-   Analyse available datasets in diversitydatakids.org 
-   Pick few related topics for conversion to natural language. 
-   Import corresponding dataset from diversitydatakids.org website using Data API provided by the web page. 
-   Use NLG to transform structured numeric data to natural language like English. 
-   Create an interactive dashboard to display the generated natural language.
###   Natural Language Generation(NLG):
-   Natural-language generation (NLG) is a software process that transforms structured data into natural language.

## 2. Unbiased news recommendation  
  - Many of the news platforms these days include biased and one sided opinions, and in order to gain complete information and form unbiased opinions we need to view it from the maximum number of political lenses on a variety of platforms. Online recommendation systems are built around the idea of making recommendations 'similar' to a user's search interests. While this is helpul in most searches, news platforms should include 'similar' search recommendations as well as those putting up the opposite argument.
Our system aims to use semantic analysis to provide an unbiased news recommendation feature that gauges user interest through the news links he visits, and makes recommendations so that he gets the complete picture. 

## 3. Masters Admit Prediction App:
 -  Lot of students have anxiety about whether they will make it to their dream university. Sometimes they underestimate themselves while at times they overestimate. Our goal is to provide a solution in the form of a web app where given a set of metrics such as gpa, gre etc the app can determine your chances of making it to the university. It also provides you with a list of universities under categories such as ambitious, moderate etc which you could potentially apply to.
