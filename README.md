####1.Masters Admit Prediction App:
 -  Lot of students have anxiety about whether they will make it to their dream university. Sometimes they underestimate themselves while at times they overestimate. Our goal is to provide a solution in the form of a web app where given a set of metrics such as gpa, gre etc the app can determine your chances of making it to the university. It also provides you with a list of universities under categories such as ambitious, moderate etc which you could potentially apply to.
 
####2. Disease Outbreak Detection/ Epidemic detection:
  -  ####goal:
        - Develop a web application that provides insight into a possible outbreak of a disease.  
  -  ####Abstract:
    - We have witnessed the devastating effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic on public health & the economy. Even though we are living in a world of digital data & Artificial Intelligence, we failed to identify the outbreak on time & contaminate it.
	 - One reason being less awareness to people of the outbreak and the other being not making use of existing hospital digital records.
	 - After the COVID-19 outbreak, we have seen the evolution of many innovative web & mobile apps providing essential information to the public thereby increasing awareness.
	 - Collection & analysis of inpatient reported symptoms & illness data from various health care centers will give us an insight into possible disease outbreaks in a particular location.
	 - This extracted information would provide more awareness to health care officials & make it easier for them to take appropriate actions in time.
	- Due to patient privacy & confidentiality, not much information about daily medical records is available to the public. So we create a dataset with randomized data to implement & test our algorithms.
