#### 1. Unbiased news recommendation  
  - Many of the news platforms these days include biased and one sided opinions, and in order to gain complete information and form unbiased opinions we need to view it from the maximum number of political lenses on a variety of platforms. Online recommendation systems are built around the idea of making recommendations 'similar' to a user's search interests. While this is helpul in most searches, news platforms should include 'similar' search recommendations as well as those putting up the opposite argument.
Our system aims to use semantic analysis to provide an unbiased news recommendation feature that gauges user interest through the news links he visits, and makes recommendations so that he gets the complete picture. 

#### 2. Disease Outbreak/Epidemic Detection:
-   We have witnessed the devastating effects of the recent COVID-19 pandemic on public health & the economy. Even though we are living in a world of digital data & Artificial Intelligence, we failed to identify the outbreak on time & contaminate it. One reason being less awareness to people of the outbreak and the other being not making use of existing hospital digital records. Collection & analysis of inpatient reported symptoms & illness data from various health care centers will give us an insight into possible disease outbreaks in a particular location. This extracted information would provide more awareness to health care officials & make it easier for them to take appropriate actions in time. Due to patient privacy & confidentiality, not much information about daily medical records is available to the public. So we create a dataset with randomized data to implement & test our algorithms.

#### 3. Masters Admit Prediction App:
 -  Lot of students have anxiety about whether they will make it to their dream university. Sometimes they underestimate themselves while at times they overestimate. Our goal is to provide a solution in the form of a web app where given a set of metrics such as gpa, gre etc the app can determine your chances of making it to the university. It also provides you with a list of universities under categories such as ambitious, moderate etc which you could potentially apply to.
